Today, I decided to go get groceries. - nʊv bɔmvʊð zʊʒ ɔlɔɹi lʊmhi
I wanted to go yesterday, but it was raining. - vɔhbiðdʒʊl haʊŋ-lʊmhi vim ðɔmhil rʊzaʊʒ
I don’t like the rain. - aʊð ðɔmhil laʊʒvɔŋ
Rain makes things wet. - ðɔmhil rʊzaʊʒ dʒaʊiŋ daʊɔl ɹiv ɹɔlhivɔ
When things are wet, it’s harder to travel. 
When it’s harder to travel, it makes you want to travel less. 
That is why I’m getting groceries today. 
Tomorrow? 
I’m not sure about tomorrow. 
I think it will rain tomorrow. 
If it rains, I’ll stay home. 
If it doesn’t rain, I’ll go to the park. 
But since I’m not sure, I don’t want to commit.
