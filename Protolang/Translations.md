Today, I decided to go get groceries. - nʊv bɔmvʊð zʊʒ ɔlɔɹi lʊmhi
I wanted to go yesterday, but it was raining. - vɔhbiðdʒʊl haʊŋ-lʊmhi vim ðɔmhil rʊzaʊʒ
I don’t like the rain. - aʊð ðɔmhil laʊʒvɔŋ
Rain makes things wet. - ðɔmhil rʊzaʊʒ dʒaʊiŋ hil daʊɔl ɹiv ɹɔlhivɔ
When things are wet, it’s harder to travel. - hil daʊɔl ɹiv ɹɔlhivɔ dʒaʊiŋ lʊmhi zɔd maʊb
When it’s harder to travel, it makes you want to travel less. - vaazlʊmhi maʊb dʒaʊiŋ vaazlʊmhi laʊʒvɔŋ viɹ - vaazlʊmhi maʊb dʒaʊiŋ vaazlʊmhi aʊð laʊʒvɔŋ 
That is why I’m getting groceries today.  - vɔhdʒʊl bɔðzɔ ɔlɔɹi hɔbbi
I think it will rain tomorrow. - vɔhbaʊddʒʊl ðɔmhil rʊzaʊʒ vʊðɔ
If it rains, I’ll stay home. - ðɔmhil rʊzaʊʒ hiʒ vaʊ ðʊvih haʊŋ vɔbaʊl
If it doesn’t rain, I’ll go to the park. - aʊð ðɔmhil rʊzaʊʒ hiʒ hɔŋ haʊŋ lʊmhi
But since I’m not sure, I don’t want to commit. - aʊð vaʊv dʒaʊiŋ aʊð haʊŋɔððɔ




The sun is bright and warm. 
It makes the day feel nice. 
Birds fly in the sky. 
Some are big, and some are small. 
They sing songs that make us happy.

The trees are tall. 
Their leaves are green. 
They give shade when it's hot. 
People sit under the trees and chat. 
Friends laugh together. 
It's a good time.

At night, the moon comes out. 
It's a silver circle in the dark sky. 
Stars twinkle around it. 
Some look like animals. 
Some look like letters. 
We make wishes on them.

Every day is different. 
Sometimes it rains, and we see rainbows. 
Sometimes it's cold, and we wear cozy clothes. 
No matter what, there's always something to enjoy.
