Today, I decided to go get groceries. - nʊv bɔmvʊð zʊʒ ɔlɔɹi lʊmhi
I wanted to go yesterday, but it was raining. - vɔhbiðdʒʊl haʊŋ-lʊmhi vim ðɔmhil rʊzaʊʒ
I don’t like the rain. - aʊð ðɔmhil laʊʒvɔŋ
Rain makes things wet. - ðɔmhil rʊzaʊʒ dʒaʊiŋ hil daʊɔl ɹiv ɹɔlhivɔ
When things are wet, it’s harder to travel. - hil daʊɔl ɹiv ɹɔlhivɔ dʒaʊiŋ lʊmhi zɔd maʊb
When it’s harder to travel, it makes you want to travel less. - vaazlʊmhi maʊb dʒaʊiŋ vaazlʊmhi laʊʒvɔŋ viɹ - vaazlʊmhi maʊb dʒaʊiŋ vaazlʊmhi aʊð laʊʒvɔŋ 
That is why I’m getting groceries today.  - vɔhdʒʊl bɔðzɔ ɔlɔɹi hɔbbi
I think it will rain tomorrow. 
If it rains, I’ll stay home. 
If it doesn’t rain, I’ll go to the park. 
But since I’m not sure, I don’t want to commit.
